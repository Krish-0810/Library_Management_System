# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a Java-based application that allows users to perform basic library operations such as adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books. This project is built using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring that the code is robust, well-tested, and maintainable.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Users can add new books to the library by providing a unique identifier (ISBN), title, author, and publication year.
- **Borrow Books**: Users can borrow books from the library. The system checks for availability before allowing a book to be borrowed.
- **Return Books**: Users can return borrowed books, and the system updates the availability status accordingly.
- **View Available Books**: Users can view a list of all available books in the library.

## Why This Project is Noteworthy

This Library Management System project is noteworthy for several reasons:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The entire project is built following the TDD methodology, ensuring that tests are written before the actual implementation. This results in a high level of test coverage and code reliability.
2. **Clean Code Practices**: The project adheres to clean coding principles, including meaningful variable names, modular design, and comprehensive comments, making the code easy to understand and maintain.
3. **SOLID Principles**: The codebase follows SOLID principles, which promote good object-oriented design and architecture, making the system easy to extend and modify.
4. **Educational Value**: This project serves as an excellent example for developers looking to learn about TDD, object-oriented programming in Java, and best practices in software development.
